# Tibia simple bot

Just a simple bot that probably will never get fancy as I initially wanted. Currently has only exercise weapon training script.

## Requirements

You'll need to use MacOS and have `node` installed in order to run the script

## Usage

Use the screenshot mode (`CMD + SHIFT + 4`) in order to get screen coordinates

- Put the dummy screen coordinates in the `ObjectFinder` file
- Put the exercise weapon hotkey screen coordinates in the `Bot` file
- Make sure to install every dependency running `yarn`
- Run `node index.js` to start the script
- Quickly switch to tibia window and come back after the server save to do it again
